# Cutting releases

There are multiple things in this repository that can be released:

- The signalling server container image
- The `/library` NPM package
- The `/ui-library` NPM package
- The entire repo and built frontend as a Github release .zip/tar.gz archive

## The `/Common` NPM package
1. Switch to the target branch (e.g 5.5)
2. Make/merge any changes into `/Common` directory
3. Based on the changes made, bump the version number according to [semver](https://semver.org/) in the [`package.json`](https://github.com/EpicGamesExt/PixelStreamingInfrastructure/blob/master/Common/package.json#L3) file
4. Commit the changes to the `package.json` file.
5. This will automatically kick off a [this action](https://github.com/EpicGamesExt/PixelStreamingInfrastructure/actions/workflows/publish-common-library-to-npm.yml) for a build+push to NPM.

## The `/Signalling` NPM package

6. Commit the changes to `package.json` and potentially the `package-lock.json` file.
7. This will automatically kick off a [this action](https://github.com/EpicGamesExt/PixelStreamingInfrastructure/actions/workflows/publish-ui-library-to-npm.yml) for a build+push to NPM.

## Signalling Server Container
1. Switch to the target branch (e.g 5.5)
2. Make/merge any changes into `/SignallingWebServer` directory
3. This will automatically kick off a [this action](https://github.com/EpicGamesExt/PixelStreamingInfrastructure/actions/workflows/container-images.yml) for a build+push of the signalling server container image.

## The Github releases archives
1. Switch to the target branch (e.g 5.5)
2. Make/merge any changes anywhere in the repo.
3. Based on the changes made, bump the version number according to [semver](https://semver.org/) in the [`RELEASE_VERSION`](https://github.com/EpicGamesExt/PixelStreamingInfrastructure/blob/master/RELEASE_VERSION) file.
4. Commit the changes to `RELEASE_VERSION` file.
6. This will automatically kick off a [this action](https://github.com/EpicGamesExt/PixelStreamingInfrastructure/actions/workflows/create-gh-release.yml) for tagged Github release with .zip and .tar.gz archives.

## Handling multiple changes
If multiple changes have been made, the order of releases should usually be like so:

1. `/Common`
2. `/Signalling`
3. `/library`
4. `/ui-library`
5. `/SignallingWebServer`
6. `RELEASE_VERSION` file

## Github Actions is failing because of unpublished libraries
You may get into a situation where a PR is failing Github Actions checks due to unpublished libraries, if you are certain everything is working and
up to date except that the libraries have not been published you can add this magic string to your commit `#bypass-publish-check` that will skip the check
of building everything using published libraries. Once the PR is landed, this check will run again and you can bump the library versions in a separate PR/commit.
