# Creating a new release branch

- Make sure master branch is up to date.
- Make sure the previous release branch has been merged back into master if needed.
- Create the new release branch. `git checkout -b UEx.x`
- Update the source code imports to update the package names.
	- Can usually be done with a grep/swap.
	- There are several exports that also need to be updated in `implementations/typescript`
- Update version references in github actions.
	- `.github/workflows/healthcheck-streaming.yml`
	- `.github/workflows/healthcheck-frontend.yml`
- Update the readme in master to update all the mentioned versions and push them all by one release.
	- Health checks
