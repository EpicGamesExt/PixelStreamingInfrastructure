# Experimental Pixel Streaming 2 plugin release in 5.5

From UE 5.5 onwards, Epic Games introduced a layer that makes it easier to maintain WebRTC internally. As the original Pixel Streaming plugin used WebRTC directly, this change meant that we had to introduce a new plugin to ensure a better transition phase for the developers who have developed custom solutions on top of the PixelStreaming plugin. For now, both the original Pixel Streaming plugin and the Pixel Streaming 2 plugin will be shipped with Unreal Engine to give users time to migrate.

We have created a [migration guide](/Docs/pixel-streaming-2-migration-guide.md) to ensure a smooth transition for all licensees using the plugin and to highlight all major changes between the plugins.

# The official home for the Pixel Streaming servers and frontend!
The frontend and web server elements for Unreal Pixel Streaming (previously located in `Samples/PixelStreaming/WebServers`) are now in this repository, for all to contribute to. They are referred to as the **Pixel Streaming Infrastructure**.

## Getting Started
To **build** and **run** everything you need to connect to the Pixel Streaming plugin simply run the following in the root of your `PixelStreamingInfrastructure` directory:

**Windows**
```
.\SignallingWebServer\platform_scripts\cmd\start.bat
```

**Linux or Mac**
```
./SignallingWebServer/platform_scripts/bash/start.sh
```

If you want to work on a specific library within this monorepo then `cd` into that directory and run:

`npm install`
`npm run build-all`

If you want to install all the dependencies and flush any existing `node_modules`, go to the root of the repo and run:

`npm install`

This works because this monorepo is using [NPM workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces?v=true). Using NPM workspaces means:

- Each sub-workspace within the monorepo does not have its own `package-lock.json`. There is only a single one in the root.
- Common dependencies are hoisted into the root `node_modules` directory.
- Some sub-workspaces will not have a `node_modules` directory because all their dependencies exist in the root `node_modules`.
- When working locally within the monorepo dependencies on sub-workspaces will first try to use a local `symlink` to those dependencies instead of downloading the published packages from NPM. For example, `pixelstreaming-frontend` depends on `pixelstreaming-common`, when working in this repo that dependency will first be attempted to be resolved using the local `./Common` directory.

## Goals

The goals of this repository are to:

- Increase the release cadence for the Pixel Streaming servers (to mitigate browser breaking changes sooner).
- Encourage easier contribution of these components by Unreal Engine licensees.
- Facilitate a more standard web release mechanism.
- Grant a permissive license to distribute and modify this code wherever you see fit (MIT licensed).

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to our repository, please reference our [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md). Thank you for your time and your efforts!

## Contents

The Pixel Streaming Infrastructure contains reference implementations for all the components needed to run a pixel streaming application. They are structured as separate projects, which work together, but are designed to be modular and interoperable with other implementations which use WebRTC technology. These implementations include: 
- A signalling web server, called Cirrus, found in [`SignallingWebServer/`](SignallingWebServer/).
- An SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit), found in [`SFU/`](SFU/).
- A common library for frontend applications, found in [`Common/`](Common/).
- Several frontend projects for the WebRTC player and input, found in [`Frontend/`](Frontend/):
  - shared libraries for [communication](Frontend/library/) and [UI](Frontend/ui-library/) functionality
  - separate [implementations](Frontend/implementations/) using different techologies such as TypeScript or React/JSX
  - For detailed information, see the [/frontend](/Frontend/).
- A signalling protocol test application that validates implementations of the signalling protocol, found in [`Extras/SS_Test/`](Extras/SS_Test/).

## Releases
We release a number of different components under this repository, specifically:

- Container images for the signalling server
- NPM packages for the frontend
- Source releases of this repo with the reference frontend built as a minified js bundle
