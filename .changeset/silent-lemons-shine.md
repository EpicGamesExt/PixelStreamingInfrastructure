Make the REST API reachable when Wilbur is started with `--rest_api` but without `--serve`. Previously the Express app that hosts the `/api/*` routes was only bound to an HTTP listener inside the `serve` branch, so with `--serve=false --rest_api=true` the listener never started and requests were answered by the WebSocket upgrade handler on the player port (`426 Upgrade Required`). The HTTP listener now starts whenever `rest_api` or `serve` is set. Static file serving and the homepage route are gated by a new `IWebServerConfig.serveStatic` flag (the port listener runs independently of static serving), and the rate limiter is registered before any route handlers so the homepage and any downstream-registered routes are all rate-limited. Wilbur logs at startup which mode it is running in.
