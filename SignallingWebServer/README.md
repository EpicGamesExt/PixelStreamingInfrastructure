# Wilbur

A Direct replacement for cirrus.

Wilbur is a small intermediary application that sits between streamers and other peers. It handles the initial connection negotiations and some other small ongoing control messages between peers as well as acting as a simple web server for serving the [Frontend](/Frontend/README.md) web application.

Differences of behaviour from the old cirrus are described [here](from_cirrus.md).

## Building
Building is handled by `npm` and `tsc`. However, the easiest method to install and build everything is to invoke:

```
.\SignallingWebServer\platform_scripts\cmd\start.bat --dev
```

This will install and build all the required components.

## Building manually

However, if you would like to manually build them yourself (or build other configs), you will need to:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
# Or npm run build-dev
```

In the `/common`, `/Signalling`, and `/SignallingWebServer` directories (in that order).

Each of these will output built files into the `build` or `dist` directory.

## Running
After you have build the server you can run it with both `node` directly or the `npm start` script.
```
npm start -- [arguments]
```
or
```
node dist/index.js [arguments]
```
Invoking `npm start -- --help` or `node dist/index.js --help` will display the configuration options.
```
Usage: node dist/index.js [options]

A basic signalling server application for Unreal Engine's Pixel Streaming applications.

Options:
  -V, --version                 output the version number
  --log_folder <path>           Sets the path for the log files. (default: "logs")
  --log_level_console <level>   Sets the logging level for console messages. (choices: "debug", "info", "warning", "error", default: "info")
  --log_level_file <level>      Sets the logging level for log files. (choices: "debug", "info", "warning", "error", default: "info")
  --console_messages [detail]   Displays incoming and outgoing signalling messages on the console. (choices: "basic", "verbose", "formatted", preset: "verbose")
  --streamer_port <port>        Sets the listening port for streamer connections. (default: "8888")
  --player_port <port>          Sets the listening port for player connections. (default: "80")
  --sfu_port <port>             Sets the listening port for SFU connections. (default: "8889")
  --max_players <number>        Sets the maximum number of subscribers per streamer. 0 = unlimited (default: "0")
  --serve                       Enables the webserver on player_port. (default: true)
  --http_root <path>            Sets the path for the webserver root. (default: "D:\\PixelStreamingInfrastructure\\SignallingWebServer\\www")
  --homepage <filename>         The default html file to serve on the web server. (default: "player.html")
  --https                       Enables the webserver on https_port and enabling SSL (default: false)
  --https_port <port>           Sets the listen port for the https server. (default: 443)
  --ssl_key_path <path>         Sets the path for the SSL key file. (default: "certificates/client-key.pem")
  --ssl_cert_path <path>        Sets the path for the SSL certificate file. (default: "certificates/client-cert.pem")
  --https_redirect              Enables the redirection of connection attempts on http to https. If this is not set the webserver will only listen on https_port. Player websockets will still listen on player_port. (default: true)
  --rest_api                    Enables the rest API interface that can be accessed at <server_url>/api/api-definition (default: false)
  --peer_options <json-string>  Additional JSON data to send in peerConnectionOptions of the config message. (default: "")
  --log_config                  Will print the program configuration on startup. (default: true)
  --stdin                       Allows stdin input while running. (default: false)
  --save                        After arguments are parsed the config.json is saved with whatever arguments were specified at launch. (default: false)
  -h, --help                    Display this help text.
```
These CLI options can also be described in a `config.json` (default config file overridable with --config_file) by specifying the command option name and value in a simple JSON object. eg.
```
{
	"log_folder": "logs",
	"log_level_console": "info",
	"log_level_file": "info",
	"streamer_port": "8888",
	"player_port": "80",
	"sfu_port": "8889",
	"serve": true,
	"http_root": "www",
	"homepage": "player.html",
	"log_config": false,
	"stdin": false
}
```
Given these options, to start the server with the closest behaviour as the old cirrus, you would invoke,
```
npm start -- --console_messages --https_redirect verbose --serve --log_config --http_root www --homepage player.html
```
Note that `www` being used as the http root assumes your Frontend is in that directory.

## Development
This implementation is built on the [Signalling](../Signalling) library which is supplied as a library for developing signalling applications. Visit its [documentation](../Signalling/docs) for more information.

A development mode that watches for changes to libraries, frontend and source exists in this project. To utilize it you can invoke `npm run develop`. This will kick off a series of watchers that all watch the individual components of the signalling server and frontend for changes and will auto build and restart the signalling server, or in the case of frontend changes, redeploy the frontend for the signalling server to serve.
#### Note
By default, when the signalling server launches in this mode, the port to access the frontend changes to 1025 and so you will need to visit `http://localhost:1025` to access the frontend. This is to get around the need for elevated permissions for port 80.

### Self-signed certificates
During development it may be useful to work with self-signed SSL certificates (e.g. HTTPS is required for some features like XR and microphone usage). Self signed certificates can be generated using the following instructions:

1. Navigate to the `SignallingWebServer` directory.
2. Create a subdirectory called `certificates`.
3. Open Git Bash or your preferred shell.
4. Run `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout client-key.pem -out client-cert.pem -sha256 -nodes`
5. Ensure your `config.json` contains:

```json
"ssl_key_path": "certificates/client-key.pem",
"ssl_cert_path": "certificates/client-cert.pem",
```
